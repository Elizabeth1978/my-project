                <p>My Name is Elizabeth Bekele This Is my Developer History.I graduated business and administration.
                    And I have worked for almost 25 years.I can say that I am a responsible and hard working person.
                    Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people.I
                    appreciate friendship and people who surround me. I do have a great connection with my family.I
                    have
                    a daughter who is learning in university and a two year old son.My experience with computers was
                    challenging but in a good way.I was 16 years old I was learning a computer in the trailing
                    center.It
                    was challenging because 1 desktop for 2 or 3 students.I started working at the Government office
                    as
                    a full time employee in my country.I have a personal computer and an office computer.I have been
                    working different positions and all of them required using a computer.can agree that I have an
                    Excellent Microsoft skill and internet exploration.I want to learn web development because I
                    want to
                    broaden my knowledge of learning new computer skills.Therefore,I joined Refcode and I am excited
                    and
                    happy for this chance to ring the change. I came across web development course while using an
                    htpp file. I was curious the term and I started.browsing how to build my own files. And starting
                    from
                    their I started to learn the structure.as well as the astatic and function of building a
                    web.After a
                    while hearing this class I decide to learn and have a better knowledge.This year is the year
                    that I
                    would say I started the web development that have been baffling.me about the web and internet. I
                    also opened a github account and start loads of javascript and css.projects.</p>
